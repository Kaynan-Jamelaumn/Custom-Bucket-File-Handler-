# Custom-Bucket-File-Handler-
Just for me to download/upload/write files easier 

if it is poo code:
  
    --- secrets.py to put your access key of AWS
    --- the other file it's where you "trigger" the events

if it is alternative code:

    --- code with functions is in handler.py 

    --- event.py is to set "objects" to use in handler.py 

    --- secrets.py to put your access key of AWS
